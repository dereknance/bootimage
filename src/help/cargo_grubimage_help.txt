Creates a bootable disk image from a Rust kernel

USAGE:
    cargo grubimage [BUILD_OPTS]        Create a bootable disk image

    (for other forms of usage see `grubimage --help`)

BUILD_OPTS:
    Any options are directly passed to `cargo build` (see
    `cargo build --help` for possible options). After building, a bootloader
    is downloaded and built, and then combined with the kernel into a bootable
    disk image.

CONFIGURATION:
    The behavior of `cargo grubimage` can be configured through a
    `[package.metadata.grubimage]` table in the `Cargo.toml`. The
    following options are available to configure the build behavior:

    [package.metadata.grubimage]
    # The cargo subcommand that will be used for building the kernel.
    #
    # For building using the `cargo-xbuild` crate, set this to `xbuild`.
    build-command = ["build"]
